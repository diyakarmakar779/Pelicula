Microsoft Engage 2022 - A Content-based Movie Recommender System 

## About
Are you looking for a movie? Do you want to watch a comedy but in Bollywood? Or are you just confused with what to watch next. This recommender system is based on the preferences of users and recommends the best five similar movies based on that.

The details of the movies(title, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api.
